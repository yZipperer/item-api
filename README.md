## Overview:
  This is a product API for grocery and item data. It will return information including prices, names, images descriptions, ids, nutrition information (and USDA nutrition information on produce), and many more things.

  I built this API when I tried finding product data for a project, but couldn't find any that worked for my needs. The database is small and only contains 37 products, but I work on adding more products every so often.
  
  ### By the Numbers:
    * 37 total items
    * 5 categories

## How to Search the Data

  1. You will begin by typing one of the above routes into either a search bar, or you can make a request through a command line
  2. there are 2 route parameters to know
    - cat     This parameter is used to search based on category
    - brand     This parameter is used to search based on brand
  3. Use different parameter values to search for what you need
