## Overview:
  This is a product API for grocery and item data. It will return information including prices, names, images descriptions, ids, nutrition information (and USDA nutrition information on produce), and many more things.

  I built this API when I tried finding product data for a project, but couldn't find any that worked for my needs. The database is small and only contains 69 products, but I work on adding more products every so often.
  
  ### By the Numbers:
    * 69 total items
    * 57 categories
    * 49 different brands
    * $162.78 worth of products
    * 89,081 total calories

  ### Contents
    * names
    * price data in USD
    * images for every product
    * nutrition information
    * descriptions
    * desired temperatures
    * displays stats on entire database
      * perfect for admin dashboard
    * ingredients
    * unique ids
    * 49 different brands
    * 69 products
    * 57 categories

## Requirements

  * Node.js
  * command line

## Installation:
  
  git clone https://github.com/yZipperer/item-api.git

  2. Once the server is running use the command line to call the routes listed below
  
## Routes:

  --- Searching ---

  http://localhost:8080/food?brand=putbrandhere            /*search based on brand*/

  http://localhost:8080/stats            /*shows stats on the items in the data set*/
  ```

## How to Search the Data

  1. You will begin by typing one of the above routes into either a search bar, or you can make a request through a command line
  2. there are 2 route parameters to know
  
    cat     This parameter is used to search based on category
    brand     This parameter is used to search based on brand
    
  3. Use different parameter values to search for what you need
