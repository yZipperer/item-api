## Overview:
  This is a product API for grocery and item data. It will return information including prices, names, images descriptions, ids, nutrition information (and USDA nutrition information on produce), and many more things.

  I built this API when I tried finding product data for a project, but couldn't find any that worked for my needs. The database is small and only contains 64 products, but I work on adding more products every so often.

    * 64 total items
    * 46 categories

  2. there are 2 route parameters to know
  
    cat     This parameter is used to search based on category
    brand     This parameter is used to search based on brand
    
  3. Use different parameter values to search for what you need
  
  Sample URL:

  http://localhost:8080/food?cat=putCATEGORYhere&brand=putBRANDhere
